    Modular Capability-Based Operating System
              Built from Scratch.

## What is MoiMoiOS?

**MoiMoiOS** is a modular, secure, lightweight operating system designed from the ground up.  
It centers around a **capability-based security model** where apps request privileges through the auditable **Chest** service.

Rather than giving blanket superuser access, MoiMoiOS empowers fine-grained, user-controlled privilege elevation.

## Features
- Lightweight custom microkernel
- Capability-based access control
- Secure Chest service for privileged actions
- Structured service traps instead of legacy syscalls
- Modular service-driven architecture
- Designed for both embedded and desktop environments
